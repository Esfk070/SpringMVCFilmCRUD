TIMELINE:
Saturday: 
- Zoom call
- Reviewed FilmController, Film, Actor
- Kevin - to work on index.jsp
- Created 2nd jsp (error.jsp)
- error.jsp to handle: errors (failed to find, failed to add,
	failed to update, failed to delete
- FilmController (if - goes to index; else - goes to error)
- error.jsp is functional (if 1001 is entered, no film is found and displays link to index (home)
- 

	
	
Index JSP vs. Error JSP
	
Index - main entry point of the web application	
	  - contains forms, links (front end interface)
	  
Result - displays outcome (of user actions)

Error - dynamic (can be used to handle multiple types of errors)		
 	  - error.jsp reads the error message from the request attributes (& displays)
